# AI Coding Resources
This repository collects AI Coding Resources I've studied and experimented with â€” from expert practices to research papers and hands-on trials. It's not a bookmark dump, but my distilled notes and insights from things I've actually read. I only add resources I've gone through myself, and I'd love to hear your thoughts in the discussions.
